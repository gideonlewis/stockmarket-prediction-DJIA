# DJIA Stock Market Trend Prediction (IE221_Project)

This project aims to predict the trends in the stock market using historical data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The prediction is implemented using Python and involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, labeling, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the future direction of the DJIA stock market. The historical stock market data is utilized to train a machine learning model that can capture the underlying patterns and relationships.

## Project Workflow

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the historical DJIA stock market data from reliable sources such as financial APIs or publicly available datasets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data to ensure its quality and suitability for training the predictive model. This step may involve handling missing values, normalizing data, and removing outliers.

3. **Labeling**: Assign labels to the preprocessed data based on the desired prediction task. For example, labeling data as "1" for an upward trend and "0" for a downward trend.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed data that can be used to train the prediction model. This may involve technical indicators, statistical measures, or other domain-specific features.

5. **Model Training**: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm or ensemble of algorithms to train the prediction model using the labeled and feature-engineered dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. This step helps to determine the effectiveness of the prediction model.

7. **Prediction and Deployment**: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data. The predictions can be used to guide investment decisions or provide insights into the future market trends.
